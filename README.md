# UnseeAnObjectfromaVideo
we propose a novel approach for object removals with the techniques of object
detection, image inpainting and temporal loss optimization. To implement a deep neural
network-based algorithm to detect an object, remove it and fill the gap with a smooth
background in a video. The ability of the DNNs and its latest flavor, GANs (Generative
Adversarial Networks) to in-paint an image has been extensively studied and showcased, but
still there are very less focus on DNN based video inpainting algorithm due to its complexity
and temporal dependency between frames. This project tries to implement a novel algorithm
to modify an existing image inpainting method and add temporal smoothing constraints to
achieve a visually pleasing in-painted video.
